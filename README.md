Stricktly Adhere to naming convention

A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), 
as opposed to an analogue clock. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the 
"digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism.
