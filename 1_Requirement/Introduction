INTRODUCTION: 
            This project gives the overview that how to create a digital clock using C language. Actually this project is for beginners, 
            who just learn to code and want to implement it in actual application. So this system is basically for some practical purpose. 
            There is a small program and we can code it just in 15 minutes. Declare three variables for an hour, minutes and for AM or PM.
	    
           A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock.
Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. 
(Both analogue and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "clockwork" mechanisms with digital displays are rare).

CONSTRUCTION:
         Digital clocks typically use the 50 or 60 hertz oscillation of AC power or a 32,768 hertz crystal oscillator as in a quartz clock to keep time. 
Most digital clocks display the hour of the day in 24-hour format; in the United States and a few other countries, a commonly used hour sequence 
option is 12-hour format (with some indication of AM or PM). Some timepieces, such as many digital watches, can be switched between 12-hour 
and 24-hour modes. Emulations of analog-style faces often use an LCD screen, and these are also sometimes described as "digital".

DISPLAY:
	To represent the time, most digital clocks use a seven-segment LED, VFD, or LCD for each of four digits. They generally also include 
other elements to indicate whether the time is AM or PM, whether or not an alarm is set, and so on. Older digital clocks used numbers painted 
on wheels, or split-flap display.

USES:
	Because digital clocks can be very small and inexpensive devices that enhance the popularity of product designs, they are often incorporated 
into all kinds of devices such as cars, radios, televisions, microwave ovens, standard ovens, computers and cell phones. Sometimes their usefulness is 
disputed: a common complaint is that when time has to be set to Daylight Saving Time, many household clocks have to be readjusted. The incorporation 
of automatic synchronization by a radio time signal is reducing this problem (see Radio clock).
