This project gives the overview that how to create a digital clock using C language. Actually this project is for beginners, 
who just learn to code and want to implement it in actual application. So this system is basically for some practical purpose. 
There is a small program and we can code it just in 15 minutes. Declare three variables for an hour, minutes and for AM or PM.

     STRENGTHS:
              It shows time in both hours and minutes and also in AM or PM.
              There is no parallax error while seeing the correct time.
              
              
     WEAKNESS:
              We cannot able to know the month and year.
